## ModelEngine 4

`creative-central` supports ModelEngine 4 by default, it can take the resource-pack
that ModelEngine generates and merge it with the resource-pack that `creative-central`
generates, this way you can use ModelEngine and any plugin that uses `creative-central`
at the same time.

### No extra configuration needed!

You don't need to do anything to make `creative-central` work with ModelEngine 4,
just have both plugins installed and they will work!
