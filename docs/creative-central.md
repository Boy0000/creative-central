## Creative Central

Welcome to the `creative-central` documentation, creative-central is a plugin
that unifies the server's resource-pack, allowing other plugins to
programmatically add resources to the server's resource-pack

`creative-central` allows administrators to use multiple plugins that
use resource-packs without generating conflicts

### I don't understand yet...

Do you know [Vault](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault)? Vault provides an API to
unify the server's permissions, chat and economy, imagine a plugin that could do
this, but for resource-packs, that's `creative-central`!


### Features
- Add resources from your manually created resource-pack
- Automatically generate the server's resource-pack
- Automatically upload the resource-pack to a server or host it locally
- Automatically send the resource-pack to everyone
- Plug & play!
- Say goodbye to bloated resource-packs! With `creative-central`, you can even have an empty resource-pack!
- **..and all the benefits from [creative](https://unnamed.team/docs/creative)**
- - Validate and compress your resource-pack
- - `adventure` support!
